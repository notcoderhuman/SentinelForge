# Phase 1 detections

## SSH_BRUTE_FORCE

- **Purpose:** identify a possible burst of failed SSH authentication.
- **Evidence:** five or more `authentication_failure` events from one source IP and `sshd`.
- **Default window:** 120 seconds; severity `high`.
- **Limitations:** shared NAT, scanners, and test activity can produce this pattern. It does not identify an attacker or prove compromise.
- **ATT&CK:** T1110 (Brute Force) is a contextual mapping, not detection logic.

## REPEATED_AUTH_FAILURE

- **Purpose:** highlight repeated failures for one known account.
- **Evidence:** three or more failures for one username within 120 seconds; severity `medium`.
- **Limitations:** account names may be missing or spoofed in source logs.

## SUCCESS_AFTER_FAILURES

- **Purpose:** relate a successful login to earlier failures for the same account.
- **Evidence:** a success after at least one same-account failure within 300 seconds; severity `medium`.
- **Limitations:** this does not establish compromise; legitimate users mistype passwords.

## SUSPICIOUS_SUDO_ACTIVITY

- **Purpose:** make privileged command execution observable.
- **Evidence:** a supported `sudo` line containing `user=` and `command=`; severity `low`.
- **Limitations:** the command is not automatically malicious. No command is executed by SentinelForge.
